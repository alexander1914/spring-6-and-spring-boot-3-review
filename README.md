**Spring:**
   makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Springâ€™s focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has made it the world's most popular Java framework.

**Spring boot:** 
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

**Features**
 - Create stand-alone Spring applications
 - Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
 - Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
 - Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
 - Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
 - Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

**Spring JPA:**
part of the larger Spring Data family, makes it easy to easily implement JPA-based (Java Persistence API) repositories. It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.
Implementing a data access layer for an application can be quite cumbersome.
Too much boilerplate code has to be written to execute the simplest queries. Add things like pagination, auditing, and other often-needed options, and you end up lost.

**Features**
- Getting Started: Sophisticated support to build repositories based on Spring and JPA
- Various Query Methods: Pagination support, dynamic query execution, ability to integrate custom data access code
- Validation of @Query annotated queries at bootstrap time
- Support for Querydsl predicates and type-safe JPA queries
- Auditing: Transparent auditing of domain class
- Configuration: Modern configuration using annotations as well as legacy support for XML-based systems.
