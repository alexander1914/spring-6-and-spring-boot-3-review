 - **Spring:**
   makes programming Java quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Springâ€™s focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has made it the world's most popular Java framework.

- **Spring boot:** 
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
 - We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

**Features**

 - Create stand-alone Spring applications
 - Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)
 - Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration
 - Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible
 - Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration
 - Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
