# RESTFull APIs
Is stands for Representational State Transfer API it is a type of API (Application Programming Interface) that allows communication between different systems over the internet.

**REST APIs** work by sending requests and receiving responses, typically in JSON format, between the client and server.

**@RestController:** is an annotation that s a specialized version of the controller.
It includes the **@Controller** and **@ResponseBody** annotations, and as a result, simplifies the controller implementation.

**@GetMapping:** is an annotation that used to map HTTP GET requests to a specific handler method in a controller,
acting as a shortcut for **@RequestMapping**(method = RequestMethod. **GET**)

**@PathVariable:** is an annotation that extracts values from URI templates in HTTP requests.
It enables dynamic path segments in URLs to be mapped to method parameters in controller methods.

**@RequestParam:** is an annotation that enables Spring to extract input data that may be passed as a query, 
form data or any arbitrary custom data.

**@PostMapping:** is an annotation that Spring annotation that is used to map HTTP POST requests onto specific handler methods. 
It is a shortcut for **@RequestMapping** annotation with (method = RequestMethod. **POST**) attribute.

**@RequestBody:** is an annotation that typically used with GET methods to write the response body content.

**@ResponseStatus:** is an annotation that control HTTP responses in Spring applications.

**@PutMapping:** is an annotation that Spring annotation that is used to map HTTP PUT requests onto specific handler methods. 
It is a shortcut for **@RequestMapping** annotation (with method = RequestMethod. **PUT**) attribute.

**@DeleteMapping:** is an annotation that  is used to map HTTP DELETE requests onto specific handler methods.
It is a shortcut for **@RequestMapping** annotation with (method = RequestMethod. **DELETE**) attribute.

**ResponseEntity** is the class in the Spring Framework that represents the entire HTTP response, 
including the status code, headers, and body.
It is a part of the org.springframework.http package and is a powerful tool for controlling the output of the RESTFull services.

**@RequestMapping** is an annotation that Spring MVC maps incoming HTTP requests to controller methods.
It works with the DispatcherServlet, which routes requests to the correct handler.
